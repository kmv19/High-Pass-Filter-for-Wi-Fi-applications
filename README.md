# High-Pass-Filter-for-Wi-Fi-applications
High pass filter with 50 dB attenuation at 2.3 GHz and cutoff at 2.4 GHz. 

Here the filters are designed based on optimum  distributed  high  pass  filters. The optimum distributed high pass filters comprise shunt short-circuited stubs with an electrical length of θc at a specified cutoff frequency, fc. These stubs are connected by links with an electrical length of 2θc.

A typical high-pass filter configuration consists of a series capacitor paired with shunt inductors. The high pass filter may be easily designed based on a lumped
element low pass prototype, which is then transformed into highpass filter using Kuroda's identity.
